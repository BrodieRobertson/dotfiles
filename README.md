# Dot Files

I've switched from VSCode to [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) but everything will still be compatible, if anything I'll be the one to run into incompatibility issues

## VSCode Plugins

+ Auto Import
+ Auto Rename Tag
+ Code Spell Checker
+ Complete JSDoc Tags
+ Fix JSON
+ VSCodeVim

Only VSCodeVim is required to use my VSCode config files
